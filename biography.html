        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        
        <p>In 1984, Devon saw it fit to grace the small town of Kingsville, Ohio with the honor of being named his birthplace. In 1985 he breifly relocated to Sarasota, Florida, but found Hurricane Elena inhospitable and decided it best to return to his birthplace. He remained in Kingsville until 1988, when he once again relocated to a suburb of Pittsburgh. He would not return to Ohio until much later, when he had a child of his own.</p>
        
        <h2>Grade School</h2>
        
        <p>After his first few years in Pennsylvania, Devon began attending elementary school in Cranberry Township, twenty miles outside of Pittsburgh. He remained here until junior high, when he relocated to Mesa, Arizona. In Mesa, he attended Shepherd Junior High and later dropped out of Red Mountain High School, with the intent of persuing an early college degree.</p>
        
        <h2>Early Adulthood</h2>
        
        <p>Devon's first attempts at college didn't work out as planned. He initially persued a degree in mortuary science, and later fine art. He settled into the life of a bartender however, and enjoyed the fast paced work environment and easy money for ten years before deciding he once again wanted more from life. He moved to Portland, Oregon for a year in an attempt to explore his options, before returning to the Arizona desert and persuing a career in restaurant maneagement.</p>
        
        <h2>Parenthood</h2>
        
        <p>While working as an iHop manager, Devon met his wife. Soon after they were married, he accepted a position running an Einstein Bros. Bagels, and the couple relocated to Prescott, Arizona. It was here that they had their first child, and decided they wanted to raise their son in what they considered to be a better place. Devon accepted a position managing another Einstein's in his childhood hometown of Cranberry Township, and eventually the couple made their way back to Kingsville.</p>
        
        <h2>Present</h2>
        
        <p>Once back in Kingsville, Devon once again decided it was time to better his position, for the sake of his family and his relatively new son. After exploring potential new career opportunities, he decided it best to return to college and is currently attending Kent State University in Ashtabula and persuing an Associates of IT.</p>
