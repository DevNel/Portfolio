	<strong>Reflections on "Once More to the Lake"</strong>
	<br>
	<p>"Once More to the Lake," by E.B. White, tells the story of a father returning to the site of his childhood vacations with his own son. 
	It is steeped in a 
	dream-like nostalgia that grants White a reprieve from the passage of time before forcing him to confront his own mortality.</p>
	
	</summary>
	
	<p>I was born in Kingsville, Ohio and spent my early childhood split between there and a small suburb of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 
	In the fifth grade, my family moved to Arizona. It was there that I became an adult, and it was there that my son was born. The sense 
	of nostalgia that permeates "Once More to the Lake" is the same that I felt for my childhood homes. So, much like White buying his bass hooks, 
	I put my notice in at work and packed my wife and six-month-old son into my car to move back home.</p>
	
	<p>My son is now three years old, and just beginning to form the memories that will be among his earliest. Admittedly, he is too young to 
	see much of myself in him except in the broadest strokes of personality. Regardless, when I watch him play with the same kind of model train 
	or eat the same pizza that I did as a child, a part of me does slip into one of White’s transpositions. The same is true when I act out my 
	father’s role. When we drive past the same small-town square or shop at the same grocer, I can see it through my father’s eyes. The years between past
	and present melt away as the line between memory and reality blurs, much like White experiences walking his childhood roads.</p>
	
	<p>When I first returned here, even though much had changed, it was the things that didn’t that stuck out to me. The little brick post office, 
	Nelson’s quarry, the concessions at Lake Shore Park, and the log cabin my grandfather built, to list a few things, were nearly unchanged. For the first 
	weeks and months, I allowed myself to relish the familiarity of things. Eventually, I found work in the same Pennsylvania suburb where I had spent the other 
	half of my childhood. Things move faster there, and while there was still an overwhelming sense of familiarity, the illusion faded quickly. New shopping centers 
	and restaurants had been built in my twenty year absence. New housing sub-divisions had been built, and old ones disappeared. Even the hundred-year-old candy 
	shop had moved to a new location, an antique cash register being the only remnant of the original store. The current state of the town was just different enough 
	to make everything seem misremembered. What I had known as a humble, off-ramp town had been taken over by new money tech workers, looking for more affordable 
	housing outside of the city. Property values had skyrocketed, and in turn so did the amount of time I spent at work.</p>
	
	<p>Where White had a two-stroke motor to dispel his illusions, I had a cell phone. Much like White, I had brought my son to the lake over the Fourth of July. 
	While I tried to watch my son splash and play with his mother and grandmother, I was at work mentally. My job required I be available by phone when I wasn’t there 
	physically, and the calls wouldn’t stop. After I had handled their problems, I couldn’t bring my attention back to my family. The spell of the moment had been broken, 
	and that moment had been taken from me. It was a minor death in a way, and at the end of that day I made the decision to quit my job and move back to Ohio.</p>
	
	<p>In "Once More to the Lake," White finds himself drunk with nostalgia.  It grants him a taste of immortality, as his past and present converge in his mind 
	and the significance of years past dwindles. When he finds something familiar, be it an unchanged road, the sound of a motorboat, the sweet smell of summer, or an 
	old favorite song, it serves as a direct link to his memories. The more familiarity he surrounds himself with, the more immersed in his sense of nostalgia he becomes. 
	However, smaller differences stand out more in contrast. It is these differences that break the spell, whether it be a two-stroke motor or in my case, a nagging cell phone.</p>

	<strong>"Rites of Passage": Final Sentence</strong>
	<br>
	<p>No parent should ever have to bury their own children. My father has done so twice. My oldest brother died when I was in second grade, and my youngest this past summer. 
	In “My Grandmother: A Rite of Passage," Brandt writes, “Some things that happen to us can’t be borne, with the paradoxical result that we carry them on our backs the rest 
	of our lives,” and watching my father’s grief unfold has shown that to be true.</p>
	</summary>
	
	<p>When my oldest brother was killed in a motorcycle accident, I was largely too young to understand what was happening. We hadn’t grown up together, and most of my memories of him stem from sporadic visits. 
	It was mostly in the years and decades that followed that I witnessed the effect of his passing on my father. My old bedroom in my father’s house became an epitaph in memorabilia. Photographs, shirts, and the American flag from his funeral 
	appeared on the walls. When his name was spoken, it was with a quiet reverence. In death, he was baptized and canonized, his James Dean looks immortalized by the Sear’s portrait hanging on the wall.</p>
	
	<p>My father is tough in the way that only men of a prior generation can be. I’ve seen him bear heart attacks and broken bones with hardly a grimace. It goes without saying that emotional traumas register in much the same way, 
	choked down to be drowned out in silence. His grief at my brother’s passing was obscured by a distinct stoicism as far as any outsider could tell. There were, however, times when a distinct melancholy overcame him, especially around the anniversary of the accident. It went without saying that the 
	subject of my future motorcycle ownership was, of course, verboten. The cloud of my brother’s death always hung on the horizon.</p>
	
	<p>My youngest brother passed away unexpectedly earlier this year. He was found overdosed and clinging to life. It was a slow death. Doctors spent several days trying to save him, but the damage had been done. 
	While machines and defibrillators could keep his body alive, his brain had succumbed days earlier. Each revival was merely an exercise in prolonging his suffering. I stood at the back of the room and watched 
	as the decision was made to let him go. My father broke in a way that I had never seen and lack the vocabulary to describe.</p>
	
	<p>It didn’t transpire the way one imagines or sees in movies. There was no screaming, no prostrating. My father held my brother’s hand, stroked his hair, and kissed him on the forehead as he said goodbye, choking back the tears.
	He couldn’t bear to be there when the machines turned off, and it wasn’t until we had left the room that he finally broke down. The car ride home, and the phone call confirming my brother’s 
	death, were out-of-body experiences. My mind went numb. Tinnitus and radio static overtook the outside world as catharsis set in.</p>
	
	<p>In the days to follow, it was the normalcy of everything that felt wrong. My other siblings and I sorted out what we could, and my father continued in his routines as best he could. It was in the quiet moments in between that the façade broke. 
	This was the process I had been shielded from when my older brother died, the settling of reality.</p>
	
	<p> As I write this, it hasn’t yet been a year. Some days are bad, and some better. My father continues to bear what can’t be borne, though now with an added weight. The death of his sons has cast light onto his own mortality. 
	He has aged decades in days. While he does his best to carry on in quiet determination, the physical toll of grief is apparent. In quiet moments, through the static, the heartbreak plays under the surface. I wonder if this is what I’d see if I could witness the events of decades 
	passed with my today’s eyes, if maybe time has softened the blows and erased the journey to a sense of normalcy.</p>
	
	<p>For my part in everything, I’ve watched with an underlying detachment, perhaps on a subconscious level attempting to emulate the quiet strength I’d seen so often growing up. 
	It has always been the effects of loss on those left behind that has been my concern. While I do mourn the deaths of my brothers, it was only when I had time alone that I allowed myself to process them. 
	I sat on my back patio steps, cigarette smoke burning my lungs and days’ worth of withheld tears burning my eyes. The weight of my efforts to support the crumbling world around me was suffocating, and I let it bury me. 
	As I cowered and trembled, it wasn’t my personal sense of grief that struck me. Rather, the image of my father and the total and absolute heartbreak on his face played in my mind as if I’d stared too long at the sun. 
	Sometimes, when I close my eyes, the sunspots of that image still float just out of reach. The cruelty of death isn’t exacted on those taken, but on those left behind. 
	The unfairness isn’t that one’s story must end, but that it must always end mid-sentence.</p>
