        <h2>About LEGO</h2>
        <br>
        <p>The LEGO Group is a Danish company founded in 1932, best known for their plastic studded building blocks. They are family owned, and have been since their inception.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The name LEGO is an abbreviation of two Danish words that mean "play well" and it is a guiding principal for the company. They pride themselves on the fact that their toys inspire imagination and do so in an inclusive way.</p>
        <br>
        <p>LEGO introduced the Automatic Binding Brick in 1949. Arguably it is the earliest version of the LEGO brick we know and love today. In 1953, the Automatic Binding Bricks were officially christened LEGO Bricks. This is also the year they first introduced a product modern LEGO fans would recognize as true sets. These 'Gift Boxes' first contained Chevrolet cars and ambulances.</p>

        <h2>Modern LEGO</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Modern LEGO kits come in all shapes and sizes, from Star Wars space ships, to Hogwarts Castle. The brand has product lines for all types and ages of fan. Duplo are double sized lego designed for children under three. LEGO Friends are designed primarily for young girls. Lego Juniors are made for children who may not be challenged by Duplo but aren't yet old enough for some of the companies more advanced sets.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Lego also prides itself on it's educational efforts. They have several lines of STEM inspired kits. Some of these kits even involve programming, such as the Coding Express train for younger children, or the MindStorm kits which are full on robotics kits.</p>
        <br>
        <p>For adult fans (sometimes refered to as the acronym AFOL) the company has kits with up to 7500 pieces. Some of these kits can cost up to $1000 new, and can take almost a week to build. The company's Creator Expert, Ultimate Collectors Series, and Ideas sets are designed specifically for the adult audience.</p>
